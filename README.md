## Notes on API Keys

- **Never expose sensitive API keys** publicly in production.
- For this project, the Visual Crossing API key is used publicly without security risk.
- In production, store API keys on the server using environment variables.
- GitHub may warn about exposed API keys; this is fine for learning purposes but should be avoided in real apps.
